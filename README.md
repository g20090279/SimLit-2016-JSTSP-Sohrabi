## Introduction of the Matlab Scripts

Run "main_su.m" for figure 2 (single-user case), and "main_mu.m" for figure 5 (multi-user case). It is recommended to save the generated channels in your local storage by modifying the code. Afterwards, load the generated channels for simulation.

## Single-user Case

## Multi-user Case
